# trader

This project was made by David Warren for a Enterprise Software class at SJSU (CmpE 172) as a midterm assignment. 
This repo contains 2 files
      - 1 nodeJS file containing a program designed to act as a bitcoin currency exchange/market trader. Users can Buy/Sell   bitcoins with either bitcoins or (at the moment only USD) currency at the correct exchange rate.
      - 1 Output csv file that is generated from the midterm nodeJS file. Please open the csv file with either excel or numbers. 
      
      Notes:
        - This project is nearly fully complete. Full currency conversion for all bitcoin->currency is still needed beyond USD. 
        - Interaction with coinbase wallet api was removed after realizing it was not necessary.
